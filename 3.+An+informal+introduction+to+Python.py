# In addition to int and float, python supports other types of numberes such as Decimal and Fraction. Python also has built-in support for complex numbers, and uses the j or J suffix to indicatethe imagineary part (e.g. 3+5j)

# ## 3.1.2. String
# Manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result. \ can be used to escape quotes. 

# In[25]:


'spam eggs' # single quotes


# In[27]:


'doesn\'t' #'\ escapes single quote


# In[29]:


'"Yes,"he said.'


# In[30]:


"\"Yes,\" he said."

'"Isn\'t," she said.'


# In[33]:


'"Isn\'t," she said.'
print('"Isn\'t," she said.')


# In[34]:

# In[35]:


print(s)


# In[36]:


print('C:\some\name')


# In[37]:

# Strings can be indexed (subscripted) with the first character having index 0. There is no seperate character type; a character is simply a string of size one.

# ### Text Sequence Type â€” str
#     Strings are examples of sequence types, and support the common operations supported by such types.
# ### String Methods
#     Strings support a large number of methods for basic transformations and searching.
# ### Formatted string literals
#     String literals that have embedded expressions.
# ### Format String Syntax
#     Information about string formatting with str.format().
# ### printf-style String Formatting
#     The old formatting operations invoked when strings are the left operand of the % operator are described in more detail here. 

# # 3.1.3 Lists

# - first line contains a multiple assignment. on the last line this is used again, demonstrating that the expressions on the right-hand side are all evaluated first before any of the assignents take place. The right-hand side expressions are evaluated from the left to the right.
# - the while loop executes as long as the condition a<10 remains true. Any non-zero integer value is true, zero is false. The condition may also be a string or list value, in fact ay sequence; are false. The test used in the example isa simple comparison. The standard comparison operators are written the same as in C: < (less than), >(greater than), ==(equal to), <=(less than or equal to), >=(greater than or equal to) and !=(not equal to)
# - the body of te loop is indented: indentation is python's way of grouping statements. At the interactive prompt, you have to type a tab or space(s) for each indented line. In practice you will prepare more complicated input for Python with a text editor; all decent text editors have an auto-indent facility. When a compound statement is entered interactively. it must be followed by a black line to indicate completion ( since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line.) Note that each line within a basic block must be indented by the same amount. 
# - The print() function writes the value of the arguents(s) it is given. It differs from just writing the expression yo want to write in the way it handles multiple arguments, floating point quantities, and strings. Strings are printed without quotes, and a space is inserted between items, so you can format things nicely, like this:

# In[110]:


i = 256*256
print('The value of i is', i)


# The keyword argument end can be used to avoid the newline after the output, or end the output with a different string.

# In[112]:


a, b = 0, 1
while a < 1000:
    print(a, ',')
    a, b = b, a+b


# In[113]:


a, b = 0,1
while a < 1000:
    print(a, end=',')
    a, b = b, a+b


# # Footnotes:
# 1. Since ** higher precedence than -, -3**2 will be -(3**2) result in -9. To avoid this and get 9, you can use (-3)**2
# 2. \n have the same meaning with both single '...' and double "..." quotes. The only difference between the two is that within single quotes you don't need to escape " ( but you have to escape \') and vice versa
